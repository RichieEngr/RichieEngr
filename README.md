## Hello Github Visitors!

Welcome to my page, I don't want this page to be too public so congratulations if you found it.

I am only going to post projects that I feel like sharing publically - I am also trying to build this up over time though.

Right now I am working on enhancing my python skills and learning some C++ before I make my next important project which I may or may not share here.
